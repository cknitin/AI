  ## ML using azure
  - A non-experts can quickly create an effective machine learning model from data.
  - Azure Machine Learning designer: a graphical interface enabling no-code development of machine learning solutions.
  - Data metric visualization: analyze and optimize your experiments with visualization.
  - Notebooks: write and run your own code in managed Jupyter Notebook servers that are directly integrated in the studio.
