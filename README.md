# What is AI
AI is software that imitates human behaviors and capabilities.

# Machine learning
foundation for an AI system, and is the way we "teach" a computer model to make predictions and draw conclusions from data.

  ## ML using azure
  - A non-experts can quickly create an effective machine learning model from data.
  - Azure Machine Learning designer: a graphical interface enabling no-code development of machine learning solutions.
  - Data metric visualization: analyze and optimize your experiments with visualization.
  - Notebooks: write and run your own code in managed Jupyter Notebook servers that are directly integrated in the studio.

  ## Computer vision
	interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images.
  Most computer vision solutions are based on machine learning models that can be applied to visual input from cameras, videos, or images. The following table describes common computer vision tasks.

  ### Image classification
  Image classification involves training a machine learning model to classify images based on their contents. For example, in a traffic monitoring solution you might use an image classification model to classify images based on the type of vehicle they contain, such as    taxis, buses, cyclists, and so on.

  ### Object detection
  Object detection machine learning models are trained to classify individual objects within an image, and identify their location with a bounding box. For example, a traffic monitoring solution might use object detection to identify the location of different classes of   vehicle.

  ### Semantic segmentation
  Semantic segmentation is an advanced machine learning technique in which individual pixels in the image are classified according to the object to which they belong. For example, a traffic monitoring solution might overlay traffic images with "mask" layers to highlight   different vehicles using specific colors.

  ### Image analysis
  You can create solutions that combine machine learning models with advanced image analysis techniques to extract information from images, including "tags" that could help catalog the image or even descriptive captions that summarize the scene shown in the image.

  ### Face detection, analysis, and recognition
  Face detection is a specialized form of object detection that locates human faces in an image. This can be combined with classification and facial geometry analysis techniques to recognize individuals based on their facial features.

  ### Optical character recognition (OCR)
  Optical character recognition is a technique used to detect and read text in images. You can use OCR to read text in photographs (for example, road signs or store fronts) or to extract information from scanned documents such as letters, invoices, or forms.

  ### Computer vision using azure
  Image Analysis: capabilities for analyzing images and video, and extracting descriptions, tags, objects, and text.
  Face: capabilities that enable you to build face detection and facial recognition solutions.
  Optical Character Recognition (OCR): capabilities for extracting printed or handwritten text from images, enabling access to a digital version of the scanned text.
