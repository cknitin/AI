# What is AI
AI is software that imitates human behaviors and capabilities.

# Machine learning
foundation for an AI system, and is the way we 'teach' a computer model to make predictions and draw conclusions from data.

  ## ML using azure
  - A non-experts can quickly create an effective machine learning model from data.
  - Azure Machine Learning designer: a graphical interface enabling no-code development of machine learning solutions.
  - Data metric visualization: analyze and optimize your experiments with visualization.
  - Notebooks: write and run your own code in managed Jupyter Notebook servers that are directly integrated in the studio.

  ## Computer vision
	interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images.
  Most computer vision solutions are based on machine learning models that can be applied to visual input from cameras, videos, or images. The following table describes common computer vision tasks.

  ### Image classification
  Image classification involves training a machine learning model to classify images based on their contents. For example, in a traffic monitoring solution you might use an image classification model to classify images based on the type of vehicle they contain, such as    taxis, buses, cyclists, and so on.

  ### Object detection
  Object detection machine learning models are trained to classify individual objects within an image, and identify their location with a bounding box. For example, a traffic monitoring solution might use object detection to identify the location of different classes of   vehicle.

  ### Semantic segmentation
  Semantic segmentation is an advanced machine learning technique in which individual pixels in the image are classified according to the object to which they belong. For example, a traffic monitoring solution might overlay traffic images with "mask" layers to highlight   different vehicles using specific colors.

  ### Image analysis
  You can create solutions that combine machine learning models with advanced image analysis techniques to extract information from images, including "tags" that could help catalog the image or even descriptive captions that summarize the scene shown in the image.

  ### Face detection, analysis, and recognition
  Face detection is a specialized form of object detection that locates human faces in an image. This can be combined with classification and facial geometry analysis techniques to recognize individuals based on their facial features.

  ### Optical character recognition (OCR)
  Optical character recognition is a technique used to detect and read text in images. You can use OCR to read text in photographs (for example, road signs or store fronts) or to extract information from scanned documents such as letters, invoices, or forms.

  ### Computer vision using azure
  Image Analysis: capabilities for analyzing images and video, and extracting descriptions, tags, objects, and text.
  Face: capabilities that enable you to build face detection and facial recognition solutions.
  Optical Character Recognition (OCR): capabilities for extracting printed or handwritten text from images, enabling access to a digital version of the scanned text.

  ## Natural language processing 
  interpret written or spoken language, and respond in kind.
  area of AI that deals with creating software that understands written and spoken language.

  ### NLP enables you to create software that can:
  Analyze and interpret text in documents, email messages, and other sources.
  Interpret spoken language, and synthesize speech responses.
  Automatically translate spoken or written phrases between languages.
  Interpret commands and determine appropriate actions.

  For example, Starship Commander is a virtual reality (VR) game from Human Interact that takes place in a science fiction world. The game uses natural language processing to enable players to control the narrative and interact with in-game characters and starship 
  systems.

  ### NPL using azure
  Microsoft's Azure AI Language to build natural language processing solutions. Some features of Azure AI Language include understanding and analyzing text, training conversational language models that can understand spoken or text-based commands, and building 
  intelligent applications.

  Microsoft's Azure AI Speech is another service that can be used to build natural language processing solutions. Azure AI Speech features include speech recognition and synthesis, real-time translations, conversation transcriptions, and more.

  You can explore Azure AI Language features in the Azure Language Studio and Azure AI Speech features in the Azure Speech Studio. The service features are available for use and testing in the studios and other programming languages.	

  ## Document intelligence
  managing, processing, and using high volumes of data found in forms and documents.

  Document Intelligence is the area of AI that deals with managing, processing, and using high volumes of a variety of data found in forms and documents. Document intelligence enables you to create software that can automate processing for contracts, health documents, 
  financial forms and more

  ### Document intelligence using azure
  You can use Microsoft's Azure AI Document Intelligence to build solutions that manage and accelerate data collection from scanned documents. Features of Azure AI Document Intelligence help automate document processing in applications and workflows, enhance data-driven 
  strategies, and enrich document search capabilities. You can use prebuilt models to add intelligent document processing for invoices, receipts, health insurance cards, tax forms, and more. You can also use Azure AI Document Intelligence to create custom models with 
  your own labeled datasets. The service features are available for use and testing in the Document Intelligence Studio and other programming languages.

  ## Knowledge mining
  extract information from large volumes of often unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store.
  Knowledge mining is the term used to describe solutions that involve extracting information from large volumes of often unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store.
  
  ### Knowledge mining using azure
  One Microsoft knowledge mining solution is Azure AI Search, a private, enterprise, search solution that has tools for building indexes. The indexes can then be used for internal only use, or to enable searchable content on public facing internet assets.
  
  Azure AI Search can utilize the built-in AI capabilities of Azure AI services such as image processing, document intelligence, and natural language processing to extract data. The product's AI capabilities makes it possible to index previously unsearchable documents 
  and to extract and surface insights from large amounts of data quickly.

  ## Generative AI 
  create original content in a variety of formats including natural language, image, code, and 	more.

  Generative AI describes a category of capabilities within AI that create original content. People typically interact with generative AI that has been built into chat applications. Generative AI applications take in natural language input, and return appropriate 
  responses in a variety of formats including natural language, image, code, and audio.

  In Microsoft Azure, you can use the Azure OpenAI service to build generative AI solutions. Azure OpenAI Service is Microsoft's cloud solution for deploying, customizing, and hosting generative AI models. It brings together the best of OpenAI's cutting edge models and 
  APIs with the security and scalability of the Azure cloud platform.

  Azure OpenAI supports many foundation model choices that can serve different needs. The service features are available for use and testing in the Azure OpenAI Studio and other programming languages. You can use the Azure OpenAI Studio user interface to manage, 
  develop, and customize generative AI models.
